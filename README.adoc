= Collection of Neo4j Docker Compose files

This repository contains a few compose files to quickly fire up various configurations.
All configurations create files beneath `$HOME/tmp/docker/`, with each configuration in its own directory structure.

== Simple Cluster
Defines a simple causal cluster with 3 cores and 1 read replica. No default database defined, so will fall back to default 'neo4j'. APOC is included.

 * Browser URL: http://localhost:7474
 * Bolt: neo4j://localhost:7687
 * User: neo4j
 * Password: changeme

== Simple Cluster with SSL
Same as the above, but with self-signed ssl certificates. See the compose file for details.

== Fabric (Dev)
Starts a single Neo4j 4. 0 instance with Fabric enabled. The Fabric database name is `example`. This setup follows the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/fabric/configuration/#_development_setup_example[Development setup example] in the operations manual.

Database `db1` is created as default database. `db2` needs to be created via
[source]
----
:use system
create database db2
----

The availability of `db2` can be checked with `show databases`.

== Fabric Cluster
Starts a causal cluster with 3 cores and 2 Fabric instances, as described in https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/fabric/configuration/#_cluster_setup_with_no_single_point_of_failure_example[Cluster setup with no single point of failure example] in the operations manual. The ports divert slightly as to avoid port clashes (all run on localhost).

Database `db1` is created as default database. `db2` and `db3` need to be created via
[source]
----
:use system
create database db2
create database db3
----

Not all ports of the contained instances are available on the docker host. The HTTP port of `Server1` is passed to the host, so that the Neo4j browser can be reached. From there, all Bolt ports are available.
